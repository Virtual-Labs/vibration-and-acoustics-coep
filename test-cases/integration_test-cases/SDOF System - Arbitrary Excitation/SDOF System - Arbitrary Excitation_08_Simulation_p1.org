* Objective
  - To Simulate the “SDOF System - Arbitrary Excitation” experiment

* Pre conditions
  - Refer to first test case [[https://github.com/Virtual-Labs/vibration-and-acoustics-coep/blob/master/test-cases/integration_test-cases/SDOF System - Arbitrary Excitation/SDOF System - Arbitrary Excitation_01_Usability_smk.org][SDOF System - Arbitrary Excitation_01_Usability_smk.org]]

* Post conditions
  - Nil
* Test Steps
  1. Click on the Simulation link 
  2. It should re-direct to the Simulation page
  3. Click on the link"Click here for Simulator" present in the simulator page.
  4. Enter the values of mass and stiffness Click on the Cc button 
  5. Enter the values of Damping co-efficient and velocity and click on the wn button
  6. Click on the Formula button and then select the type and give the height value click on the run button
  7. Click on the reload button.

* Expected result
  1. Simulation page should be opened
  2. Content should be present with no distortions and Junk character
  3. A new tab should be opened with the Simulation Process.
  4. When we click on the Cc button , the value of Cc should be displayed on the screen.
  5. When we click on the wn button , the value of wn should be displayed on the screen.
  6. The formula should be displayed on the screen and the corresponding graph should be displayed when we click on the run button.
  7. All the values on the screen should be removed.
