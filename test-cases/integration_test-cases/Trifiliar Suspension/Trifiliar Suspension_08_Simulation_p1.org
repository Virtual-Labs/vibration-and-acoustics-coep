* Objective
  - To Simulate the “Trifiliar Suspension” experiment

* Pre conditions
  - Refer to first test case [[https://github.com/Virtual-Labs/vibration-and-acoustics-coep/blob/master/test-cases/integration_test-cases/Trifiliar Suspension/Trifiliar Suspension_01_Usability_smk.org][Trifiliar Suspension_01_Usability_smk.org]]

* Post conditions
  - Nil
* Test Steps
  1. Click on the Simulation link 
  2. It should re-direct to the Simulation page
  3. Click on the link"Click here for Simulator" present in the simulator page.
  4. Click on the calculate button and the click on the Place the body on the disc button
  5. Click on the Align center of mass of the body with center of the disc button
  6. Click on the small angular moment about  verticle axis
  7. Click on the 'Calculate the mass moment of inertia of the body'.
  8. Click on the reload button.

* Expected result
  1. Simulation page should be opened
  2. Content should be present with no distortions and Junk character
  3. A new tab should be opened with the Simulation Process.
  4. When we click on the Calculate button , the value of Moment of Inertia Of Disc should be displayed on the screen.
  5. The no:of oscilations,period of oscilations and time should be calculated and should be displayed on the screen.
  6. The value of Moment of Inertia Of Body should be displayed on the screen
  7. All the values on the screen should be removed.
