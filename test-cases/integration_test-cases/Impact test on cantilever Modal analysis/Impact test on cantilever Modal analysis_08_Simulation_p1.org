* Objective
  - To Simulate the “Impact test on cantilever Modal analysis” experiment

* Pre conditions
  - Refer to first test case [[https://github.com/Virtual-Labs/vibration-and-acoustics-coep/blob/master/test-cases/integration_test-cases/Impact test on cantilever Modal analysis/Impact test on cantilever Modal analysis_01_Usability_smk.org][Impact test on cantilever Modal analysis_01_Usability_smk.org]]

* Post conditions
  - Nil
* Test Steps
  1. Click on the Simulation link 
  2. It should re-direct to the Simulation page
  3. Click on the link"Click here for Simulator" present in the simulator page.
  4. Click on the Calculate button present in the cross section box.
  5. Select the Node from the list displayed and click on the hit the hammer button and click on the observe FRF
  6. Click on the calculate button present at the bottom of the simulation page

* Expected result
  1. Simulation page should be opened
  2. Content should be present with no distortions and Junk character
  3. A new tab should be opened with the Simulation Process.
  4. The values of  Cross Section Area,Moment of Inertia,Density and Young's Modulus values should be displayed on the screen
  5. The Vibration Analyzer graph should be displayed on the screen
  6. The fn1,fn2and fn3 values should be displayed on the screen
