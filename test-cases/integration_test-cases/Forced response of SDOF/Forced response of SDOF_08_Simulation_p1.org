* Objective
  - To Simulate the “Forced response of SDOF” experiment

* Pre conditions
  - Refer to first test case [[https://github.com/Virtual-Labs/vibration-and-acoustics-coep/blob/master/test-cases/integration_test-cases/Forced response of SDOF/Forced response of SDOF_01_Usability_smk.org][Forced response of SDOF_01_Usability_smk.org]]

* Post conditions
  - Nil
* Test Steps
  1. Click on the Simulation link 
  2. It should re-direct to the Simulation page
  3. Click on the link"Click here for Simulator" present in the simulator page.
  4. Enter the valid values in mass and stiffness fields and click on Cc button
  5. Enter the valid values in Damping coeffisient and Force Amplitude and click on run button
  6. Click on Get formula button and the click on reload button

* Expected result
  1. Simulation page should be opened
  2. Content should be present with no distortions and Junk character
  3. A new tab should be opened with the Simulation Process.
  4. When we click on the Cc button , the value of Cc should be displayed on the screen.
  5. when we click on the run button , the pendulum starts swinging and the corresponding graph should be displayed on the screen.
  6. All the values on the screen should be removed.
