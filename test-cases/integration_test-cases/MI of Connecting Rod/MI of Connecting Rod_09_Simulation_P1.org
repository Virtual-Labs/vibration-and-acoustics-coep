* Objective
  - To Simulate the “MI of Connecting Rod” experiment

* Pre conditions
  - Refer to first test case [[https://github.com/Virtual-Labs/vibration-and-acoustics-coep/blob/master/test-cases/integration_test-cases/MI of Connecting Rod/MI of Connecting Rod_01_Usability_smk.org][MI of Connecting Rod_01_Usability_smk.org]]

* Post conditions
  - Nil
* Test Steps
  1. Click on the Simulation link 
  2. It should re-direct to the Simulation page
  3. Click on the link"Click here for Simulator" present in the simulator page.
  4. Click on the Trail1,Trail2,Trail3 sequentially 
  5. Click on the average time period button(t),Calculate the moment of inertia and Moment of inertia about CG
  6. Click on the reload button

* Expected result
  1. Simulation page should be opened
  2. Content should be present with no distortions and Junk character
  3. A new tab should be opened with the Simulation Process.
  4. The values of Period of 10 Oscillations and Period of 1 Oscillations(t/10) should be displayed at their corresponding fields
  5. The average time period button(t),Calculate the moment of inertia and Moment of inertia about CG should be displayed on the screen.
  6. All the values in the fields should be cleared.
