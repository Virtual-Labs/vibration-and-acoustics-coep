* Objective
  - To Simulate the “Sine Sweep of base excitation of cantilever” experiment

* Pre conditions
  - Refer to first test case [[https://github.com/Virtual-Labs/vibration-and-acoustics-coep/blob/master/test-cases/integration_test-cases/Sine Sweep of base excitation of cantilever/Sine Sweep of base excitation of cantilever_01_Usability_smk.org][Sine Sweep of base excitation of cantilever_01_Usability_smk.org]]

* Post conditions
  - Nil
* Test Steps
  1. Click on the Simulation link 
  2. It should re-direct to the Simulation page
  3. Click on the link"Click here for Simulator" present in the simulator page.
  4. Click on the Calculate button present in the cross section box.
  5. Click on the Vibration button
  6. Click on the calculate frequency button present at the bottom of the simulation page
  7. Click on the reset button

* Expected result
  1. Simulation page should be opened
  2. Content should be present with no distortions and Junk character
  3. A new tab should be opened with the Simulation Process.
  4. The values of  Cross Section Area,Moment of Inertia,Density and Young's Modulus values should be displayed on the screen
  5. The Vibration Analyzer graph should be displayed on the screen
  6. The fn1,fn2and fn3 values should be displayed on the screen
  7. All the values displayed on the screen should be erased
