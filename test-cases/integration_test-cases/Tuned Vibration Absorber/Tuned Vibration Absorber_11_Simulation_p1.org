* Objective
  - To Simulate the “      Tuned Vibration Absorber” experiment

* Pre conditions
  - Refer to first test case [[https://github.com/Virtual-Labs/vibration-and-acoustics-coep/blob/master/test-cases/integration_test-cases/Tuned Vibration Absorber/Tuned Vibration Absorber_01_Usability_smk.org][Tuned Vibration Absorber_01_Usability_smk.org]]

* Post conditions
  - Nil
* Test Steps
  1. Click on the Simulation link 
  2. It should re-direct to the Simulation page
  3. Click on the link"Click here for Simulator" present in the simulator page.
  4. Enter the invalid values in M1,K1,M2,K2

* Expected result
  1. Simulation page should be opened
  2. Content should be present with no distortions and Junk character
  3. A new tab should be opened with the Simulation Process.
  4. An error message should be displayed on the screen as to enter the valid values in the M1.K1,M2,K2 fields.
